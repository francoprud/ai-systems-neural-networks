# Neural Networks

The objective of this practical work was to implement a multilayer neural network with **supervised learning** which approximates an unknow function *f(x, y)* given some sample values.

For more details, statement of the practical work can be found at `doc/Sistemas_de_Inteligencia_Artificial__TPE2.pdf`.

The practical work is divided in two parts.

1. **Simple Perceptron** ([Documentation and usage](https://github.com/francoprud/ai-systems-neural-networks/tree/master/src/simple-perceptron))
2. **Multilayer Perceptron** ([Documentation and usage](https://github.com/francoprud/ai-systems-neural-networks/tree/master/src/multilayer-perceptron))
